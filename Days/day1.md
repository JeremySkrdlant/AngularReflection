# Hello Angular
I have been coding in REACT for a few years now and have recently begun learning Angular.  There are quite a few things I really like about Angular.  I like how the command line can create modules for you and how they are nicely grouped with their own css, html, and typescript.  It seems really well put together.  Here are a few notes from my first day of learning angular.  

## Creating a Project
```bash
ng new projectName
```

## Running the Server
```bash
ng serve open
```

## Creating a Module
```bash
ng generate component componentName
```
